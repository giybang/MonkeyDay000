    /* NOTES 
    
Following the column’s name is a new keyword you haven’t encountered yet: each. 
    The each keyword indicates to Power Query that you want this action performed for each row in the query. 
Following this, you see the List.Product() function, 
    which indicates which columns to multiply against each other and the data type the output should take.

       //  Clean Above code with Renamed Steps
You can now make some modifications to make the code shorter:
1 Replace “Multiply” in the CalcSales line with “Gross Sales”
2 Remove the comma from the end of the CalcSales line
3 Remove the entire Rename line
4. Change the last line to read “CalcSales” instead of “Rename”

    END NOTE  */

    /* NOTES 
Note: Your line breaks may not appear in the same places—or they may
not appear at all. The key pieces to remember are (1) the CalcSales line is
being treated as one complete line of code since it was split onto two lines
in the middle of the function, and (2) the line does not end with a comma
since this line precedes the in keyword.
